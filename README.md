# CyPDP Docker Workshop May 2024

Be sure to prepare by reading [Pre-Workshop Preparation](./Pre-Workshop%20Preparation.md) and [Introduction to the core concepts of Docker and containerisation](./Introduction%20to%20the%20core%20concepts%20of%20Docker%20and%20containerisation.md).

## Part A - Create a Dockerfile and build an image for your local application

This Workshop comes with a simple Python Flask To Do Application to use as a local application that we are going to containerise. If you have not done so already, clone this repo and download the source code for the application
- git clone https://github.com/dewcservices/CyPDP-docker-workshop.git
